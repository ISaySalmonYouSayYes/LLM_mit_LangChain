The AI confirms the student ID and birthday, then offers further assistance. Kai later asks the AI to confirm the end date, which the AI does. A human then asks for their passport number, and the AI responds with **F987654321**. The human requests to forget their birthday, and the AI confirms it has been forgotten. When the human asks when their birthday is, the AI reiterates that it has been forgotten. The conversation concludes with the human asking for their name, to which the AI responds that it does not have the name stored and requests it for future reference. The human then states they no longer want their birthday forgotten and asks when it is, but the AI maintains it has been forgotten. The human also inquires about Kai's identity, and the AI clarifies that Kai is the individual who shared their details in the conversation.\n",
